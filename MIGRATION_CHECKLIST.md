**Legend:**  
✅ Complete  ⚠️ Needs verification or improvement  ❌ Not yet implemented  💭 May not be needed


## 11. Recently Completed UI Improvements
- ✅ import modal ui works like shit 
- ✅ radio buttons for import mode settings and proper saving and reading of import mode state
- ✅ test auto import mode once the backed is fixed
- ✅ Add hover/focus states
- ✅ Make sure the segmented controls have visible hover and focus outlines (e.g. a bright accent glow) so keyboard users and mouse users get clear feedback
- ✅ If no shows are present, display a friendly illustration + "Click Import to get started" call-to-action

## 12. Table & List Enhancements Needed
- ❌ Virtual scrolling
      Even if you don't paginate, windowed rendering (only mounting rows in view) will keep scroll performance rock-solid once you hit thousands of entries
- ❌ Alphabetical grouping (A → Z)
      Rather than full pagination/search, you can chunk your virtualized list by first‐letter headers—i.e. one sticky "A" row, then all "A…" shows, then "B," etc. Scanning a thousand items becomes way more navigable, and it only adds a tiny bit of markup in your render loop
- ✅ Loading / empty states
      Show a subtle skeleton row animation while data is loading
- ✅ Shift‐click range-select
      Right now you've got individual checkboxes—allow holding Shift to select a contiguous block. It maps exactly to desktop expectations and only adds a handful of lines to your click-handler logic
- ✅ Overall remove some extra spacing and padding in the nav bar and the main table to tighten things up
      remove excess spacing from all tables 1 px at a time and see changes to find one i like

## 13. Mobile & Responsive Tasks
- ❌ Need a hamburger nav or transform the table into a card list on mobile
- ❌ Responsive behavior
      On narrower viewports, you may want the two sections to stack vertically rather than squeeze horizontally. Ensuring both labels and controls wrap cleanly will maintain ease of use on tablet or phone
- ❌ the alphabet bar should expand to fill all avail vertical space more gracefully
- ❌ properly add an alphabet bar to the import modal 
- ❌ fix scroll bars site wide to remove the up and down arrows

## 14. Bug Fixes & Issues
- ❌ the home page randomly refrehses. repeatedly
- ✅ we lost the tooltip on why the import refresh is grayed out

## 15. Infrastructure Investigation
- ❌ a previous chat was going to review tdarr to see its mongo db setup in the background to advise on more robust db solution
